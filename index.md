  The design of the board was fairly simple. Vin is the power pin, and it is connected to the 3 VDC pin on the raspberry pi.  The sensor's 3v3 pin is not used. The GND pin is the common ground for the power and logic.  The SCL pin is the I2C clock pin, which is connected to the raspberry pi's I2C clock line. The SDA pin is the I2C data pin, which is connected to the raspberry pi's I2C data line.

  Today my group members and I had our meeting with our collaborator, running our ideas through him and getting some feedback from him. He was very enthusiastic towards our ideas and offers his full support to the direction of our project.
  
  I have uploaded the project budget for the LumiMonitor's temperature sensor, with the webcam price included.

<b>Entry03: 09/10/2019</b>

  Submission of the hard copy printout of the project proposal. I have completed a project schedule in the form of a gantt chart and have converted it into a PDF. This version of the schedule is uploaded into the repository and can be found <a href="https://github.com/gseridon/LumiMonitor/blob/master/Documentation/LumiMonitorScheduleGanttChart.pdf">here.</a> 
  
  This schedule is based off the due dates outlined in the <a href="https://six0four.github.io/ceng317/">CENG317 Course Repository.</a>

<b>Entry02: 09/09/2019</b>

  Completed the proposal content and the project proposal, and converted them into a PDF file. These files, along with the Excel  proposal sheet, are uploaded to my online repository, in the "Documentation" folder. I have also completed creating all the different folders needed in the repository today, leaving a note in each folder to dictate the folder's future content.
  
  The links for the uploaded documents are as follows:
  - <a href="https://github.com/gseridon/LumiMonitor/blob/master/Documentation/ProjectProposalGinoSeridonLumi.pdf">Project Proposal (PDF)</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/gseridon/LumiMonitor/blob/master/Documentation/ProposalContentGinoSeridonLumi.pdf">Proposal Content (PDF)</a>

  Lastly, I have activated the github master branch for the repository, enabling me to publish the repository website.

<b>Entry01: 09/05/2019</b>

  First day working on the Lumi Monitor project. I did a bit of research for the project to try and brainstorm some ideas for it. I have created a repository today, as well as having completed my registration along with my group members on Riipen. I'm filling out the proposal with content pretaining to the Lumi monitor and will be uploading the finished documents on github.
