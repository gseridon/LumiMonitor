  First day working on the Lumi Monitor project. I did a bit of research for the project to try and brainstorm some ideas for it.
  I have created a repository today, as well as having completed my registration along with my group members on Riipen.
  I'm filling out the proposal with content pretaining to the Lumi monitor and will be uploading the finished documents on github.
